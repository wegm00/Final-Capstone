Overview
========================================================

With the advancement of technology, mobile phones have allowed us to be connected and interact with others quickly.

However, every day it is important to save as much time as possible, and a keyboard that predicts the word we want to write can save us a lot of time by preventing us from typing more letters.

The goal of the project is to develop a data product which uses natural language processing to predict 
the next word a user may want to type.

And how we do this (Algorithm)
========================================================

The prediction algorithm developed is based on an N-Gram Language Model. This model uses a Markov Assumption in which each word depends only on the previous N words in a given string of text. For this project a series of three N-gram models have been constructed:

    Bigram: only the previous word matters
    Trigram: only the previous two words matter
    Quadgram: only the previous three words matter.

Depending on the length of text input, the prediction algorithm selects candidates from appropriately ranked N-grams. 

The Shiny Application
========================================================
ItÂ´s very easy to use:
## Steps
1.  In initial load up of the application, **"NULL"** will be
    displayed at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2.  User may then enter a partially complete sentence to make oracle 
    star working.
3.  In the Application if you want help you can press help in the upper bar. 

## Results
1.  Predicted word is shown at the Predicted Word textbox.
2.  Information on the n-gram algorithm used to predict is shown
    as a note.
