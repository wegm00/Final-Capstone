This application is developed as part of the requirement for the
**Coursera Data Science Capstone Course**. The goal of the project is to
develop a data product which uses natural language processing to predict 
the next word a user may want to type. 

### Steps

1.  In initial load up of the application, **"NULL"** will be
    displayed at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2.  User may then enter a partially complete sentence to make oracle 
    star working.

### Results

1.  Predicted word is shown at the Predicted Word textbox.
2.  Information on the n-gram algorithm used to predict is shown
    as a note.

#### Note:

The source codes for ui.R and server.R files are  available on the
GitHub repo: https://github.com/wegm00/Final-Capstone
